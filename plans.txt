TODO:
- Add other combat round sets
- Possibly add up to 5* units to help lengthen game
    - Also possible to make each combat 3 rounds instead of 5
- Add items, implement item effects
- Add items to enemy rounds
    - Will allow for infinitely more uniqueness to rounds
- Add events or change
    - Ideally a game of chance, % chance for combat, reward, or punishment
- Add merchant or change
    - Don't want players to have to stay above 50 gold to prep for it
    - Don't want players to ruin their econ for it
- Add rest or change
    - Heals some of players health
    - Player health needs balanced more, round damage should scale, but might be too little currently
- Possible other node ideas: blessing, unit duplicator
- Each noncombat node currently needs to be worth ~50 gold to be worth
    - Might lower gold gain at end of round, and add gold gain at end of node
    - Ideally players want to pick noncombat nodes and feel excited doing so
- Fix how units are displayed so they work with their new sprites
    - Maybe also add a size stat for units that can be changed

DONE:
- Fix up stats player sees
- Fix ironvale summon bug
    - Summon disappears after a round, maybe after killed
    - When breakpoint changes/is updated, summons all summons up to that
- Fix bug where summons (when spawned) and sometimes units (related to dashes) have no target in a range and freeze in place
- Once you max star a unit, remove from seeing in shop (return if sold)
- Change pool removal and add from being on reroll to being on buy and sell
- Add boss node correctly
- Make map more fun TM
- Fix item dupe on bench bug
    - Moving an item from bench to bench duplicates it
    - Fully redo bench to be much more suited for a mobile game
